# Marketplace API Setup Guide
**Step-by-Step Instructions for Amazon, eBay & Shopify**

---

## üìå Introduction

This guide will help you set up API access for your Amazon Seller Central, eBay, and Shopify accounts. This is required to connect these marketplaces to your warehouse management system.

**What is API access?**
API (Application Programming Interface) allows different software systems to communicate with each other. By setting up API access, your warehouse app will be able to automatically:
- Import orders from your marketplaces
- Update inventory quantities on your listings
- Mark orders as shipped
- Sync tracking numbers

**Who should do this?**
- The person who has admin access to your Amazon Seller Central, eBay, and Shopify accounts
- Estimated time: 1-2 hours total (spread across a few days for approvals)

**What you'll need:**
- Access to your marketplace seller accounts
- A notepad or document to save credentials (keep them secure!)
- Your business information (may be needed for verification)

### Step 1: Access Amazon Developer Central

1. Open your web browser and go to: https://developer.amazonservices.com
2. Click the **"Sign in"** button in the top right corner
3. Sign in using the **same email and password** you use for Amazon Seller Central
4. If prompted, verify your identity (may require 2-step verification)

### Step 2: Register as a Developer

1. After signing in, you'll see a page asking you to register
2. Fill in the following information:
   - **Developer Name**: Your business name or your name
   - **Email Address**: Your business email (this will receive important notifications)
   - **Phone Number**: Your business phone number
   - **Company Name**: Your registered business name
   - **Website**: Your business website (or you can use your Amazon storefront URL)
3. Read and accept the **Amazon Services Terms of Use**
4. Click **"Submit"** or **"Register"**
5. ‚úÖ You're now registered as an Amazon developer!

### Step 3: Create a Developer Application

1. After registration, go to the **"Apps & Services"** menu at the top
2. Click on **"Manage Your Apps"**
3. Click the orange **"Add New App"** button
4. Fill in the application details:

   **Application Name**:
   ```
   Warehouse Management Integration
   ```
   (or any name that helps you remember it's for your warehouse system)

   **Application Description**:
   ```
   Integration for warehouse management system to sync orders and inventory
   ```

   **OAuth Login URI**:
   ```
   https://localhost
   ```
   (This is temporary and can be updated later when your developer provides the actual URL)

   **OAuth Redirect URI**:
   ```
   https://localhost/callback
   ```
   (Same as above - temporary)

5. Click **"Save"** or **"Create App"**

### Step 4: Request API Access Permissions

1. After creating the app, you'll see your app listed
2. Click on **"Edit App"** or your app name
3. Look for the **"LWA Credentials"** section (LWA = Login with Amazon)
4. You'll see:
   - **Client ID**: A long string of letters and numbers
   - **Client Secret**: Click **"View"** to see it (another long string)
   
5. **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: Copy and save these somewhere safe:
   ```
   Amazon Client ID: [paste here]
   Amazon Client Secret: [paste here]
   ```

6. Scroll down to find **"IAM ARN"** section
7. Click **"Add IAM User"** and note down the ARN (Amazon Resource Name)

### Step 5: Enable Required API Scopes

1. Still on the same page, look for **"Roles"** or **"API Permissions"**

   - ‚úÖ **Merchant Fulfillment API** (to mark orders as shipped)
3. Click **"Save"** or **"Update"**

This is the trickiest part. You have two options:

**Option A: Request from Amazon Support** (Easier)
1. Go to Amazon Seller Central
2. Click **"Help"** at the top
3. Search for "SP-API refresh token"
4. Contact support and say: *"I need a refresh token for my SP-API application to integrate with my warehouse system"*
5. They will guide you through the authorization process
6. Save the refresh token they provide

**Option B: Use OAuth Authorization Flow** (For Developers)
1. Share your Client ID with your developer
2. They will create an authorization URL for you
3. You'll visit that URL, log in to Amazon, and authorize the app
4. You'll receive a refresh token
5. Save it securely

**‚ö†Ô∏è Save This Information:**
```
Amazon Refresh Token: [paste here]
Amazon Seller ID: [paste here - found in Seller Central > Settings > Account Info]

### Step 8: Test Your Setup

1. In the Developer Console, look for **"Test"** or **"Sandbox"**
2. Try making a test API call (your developer can help with this)
3. If it works, you're all set! ‚úÖ

## üÜò Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "I can't find the Developer section on Amazon"
**Solution**: Make sure you're on https://developer.amazonservices.com (NOT regular Amazon.com or Seller Central). It's a separate portal.

### Issue: "My eBay application was rejected"
**Solution**: This is rare, but if it happens:
1. Make sure your eBay seller account is in good standing
2. Ensure you've completed all required business information
3. Contact eBay Developer Support for clarification

### Issue: "I accidentally closed the Shopify token page"
**Solution**: 
1. Go back to Apps ‚Üí Your app ‚Üí API credentials
2. Click "Uninstall app"
3. Click "Install app" again
4. You'll see the token again (copy it this time!)

### Issue: "My tokens keep expiring"
**Solution**: 
- Amazon refresh tokens don't expire (if you have the right type)
- eBay tokens expire every 18 months - you'll need to regenerate
- Shopify tokens don't expire unless you uninstall the app
- Your developer can implement auto-refresh for tokens that expire

### Issue: "I'm not technical enough to do this"
**Solution**: 
- You can do it! Just follow the steps slowly
- Take screenshots as you go
- If stuck, most marketplaces have phone support
- Amazon: 1-866-216-1072 (US)
- eBay: Check your seller hub for your region's number
- Shopify: Help center in your admin panel
